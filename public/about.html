                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Keep Alive was born out of a common frustration: waiting for deployed applications to wake up from their slumber. As developers, we experienced firsthand how cold starts affected both user experience and performance metrics.</p>

                    <p>What started as a simple internal tool to keep our own services awake grew into a solution that developers around the world now rely on. We believe that great software should be consistently responsive, and that your users deserve seamless experiences.</p>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>We're on a mission to eliminate the "cold start problem" from modern application development. In today's cloud-native world, many services go to sleep during periods of inactivity to save resources - but this creates a terrible experience when users first arrive.</p>

                    <p>Keep Alive exists to bridge that gap - keeping your services warm, responsive, and ready to serve users instantly. No more 10-second waits, no more lost conversions, no more frustrated customers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
                    <p>Cold starts aren't just a technical annoyance - they have real business impacts. Studies show that for every second of load time, conversion rates drop by 7%. When your app takes 10+ seconds to wake up, you're effectively sending users away before they even see your product.</p>

                    <p>We believe that performance is a feature, and that every developer deserves tools that make their applications shine. By solving the cold start problem simply and elegantly, we help your services make the best possible first impression.</p>
